			<p>
                ☛ Virat Kohli  Born 5 November 1988 is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional medium-fast bowler
                Virat, a 13-year-old, is selected for the Delhi Under-15 team for the Polly Umrigar Trophy in October. He ends the campaign as Delhi's leading scorer.
                 Virat is chosen for the India Under-19 team for the first time after making an impression at the youth level for Delhi. He then had a fantastic tour of England, averaging over 100 in the one-day series.  
                 In Malaysia's Under-19 World Cup, Virat led India to win and finished the competition as one of the top three run scorers.<br><br> 
                 ☛His innate leadership abilities attracted the proper kind of attention.Royal Challengers Bangalore, an IPL team, signs Virat on a youngster contract for just Rs 12.5 lakhs when he is still a minor.  
                  Virat received his maiden call-up to the Indian ODI team and participated in the entire five-match series against Sri Lanka on the road.
                 <br><br> ☛In the fourth game of the series, he hit his first 50, a 54-run inning. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. When Virat got his first ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111, it was worth the wait for him to return to the national squad.  
                 Virat participated in every game of India's victorious World Cup campaign in 2011, scoring his only century against Bangladesh in the opening match. Despite the fact that he didn't exactly light up the tournament with his bat, his final-round remark to Sachin has since become legendary in cricket: "Sachin Tendulkar has carried the weight of the nation for 21 years." Time for us to carry him on our shoulders  
                  Every cricketer will answer "play Test cricket" when asked what their dream is. In 2011, Virat finally had the opportunity to play in his first Test match against the West Indies. Unfortunately for the charming lad, it was a forgettable experience as he scored just 19 runs in the two innings he played.  
                  In the fourth and final test against Australia in Adelaide, Kohli achieved his first test hundred under somewhat dramatic circumstances.
                 <br><br>☛ He just avoided being run out when batting with Ishant Sharma and nearly ran out of partners. However, he was unable to save India. 4-0 was our series loss.  
                  Virat led India to the CB Series final in Australia with what is undoubtedly one of the best ODI efforts by an Indian batsman, hitting 133 not out against Sri Lanka off just 86 balls. Hobart witnessed one of the greatest batting performances in history as India, who was chasing 321, reached the score in 37 overs.  In place of an injured MS Dhoni, Virat was selected the stand-in ODI captain when India visited the West Indies. 
                 <br><br>☛Earlier that year, he had also been named captain of his IPL team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore.When summoned to replace an ailing MS in Australia once more, Kohli experienced his first taste of Test captaincy. In Adelaide, he celebrated by scoring centuries in both innings. In what was an exceptional  
                  In addition to purchasing a share in the IPTL team UAE Royals, Kohli expanded his interest in tennis after becoming a co-owner of ISL football club FC Goa the year before.  
                 He produced arguably his finest innings of his young career as India defeated Australia in Mohali to go to the ICC World T20 semifinals. As opposed to the lappa kind of cricket that is typically associated with 20 over cricket, his 82 off 51 balls was a magnificent effort, carved with timing and technique.  
                 <br><br>☛Virat Kohli's reputation as one of the finest batsmen in the world continued to soar. His consistency across all formats of the game earned him accolades and admiration from fans and critics alike. Kohli's prowess with the bat was not limited to just one format; he proved his mettle in Test cricket as well, showcasing his ability to adapt and excel in the longest format of the game.
                 <br><br>☛Kohli's commitment to the sport extended beyond his individual achievements. He was actively involved in nurturing young talent and promoting the game at the grassroots level. Kohli's influence on the next generation of cricketers was profound, inspiring countless youngsters to pursue their dreams of representing their country on the cricket field.

            of the year.It established Sridevi in Bollywood.Her dance number "Nainon Mein Sapna" became a rage with Rediff stating that "the water 
            pots may have dominated most frames in 'Nainon Mein Sapna', but it was Sridevi's bejewelled outfits and headgears that stole the show".
            She followed with Tohfa, which was the highest-grossing Hindi film of 1984.The film established Sridevi as one of the leading actresses

             ☛However, it was Sadma (1983) which brought Sridevi widespread critical acclaim.A remake of her Tamil film Moondram Pirai, Sadma is included in
             iDiva's list of '10 Must Watch Movies That Weren't Blockbusters'.Sridevi's performance as a child-woman suffering from amnesia was called by Indian
              Express "a milestone in her illustrious career".Sridevi also featured in the Mid-Day's list of 'Challenging Roles played by Bollywood Actors' describing
               her act in the film as "her best performance ever".In 2012, Adil Hussain, Sridevi's co-star in English Vinglish revealed that he became a fan of the actress 
               after watching her in Sadma.[58] The Sridevi-Kamal Hassan pair also appeared on the CNN-IBN 2012 list of 'Greatest Romantic Couples on Celluloid'.

               ☛She also acted with Akkineni Nageswara Rao's son Nagarjuna in Aakhari Porattam (1988), Khuda Gawah (1992) and Govinda Govinda (1993). She has also

              <h2 class="title">
                ☛1987–1997: Superstardom, later films and hiatus
            </h2>
            ☛Sridevi followed the success of Nagina by playing a goofy crime journalist in the science fiction film Mr. India (1987) opposite Anil Kapoor, which was 
            described by Rediff as "one of the most iconic films of its time".Directed by Shekhar Kapur, it became one of the highest grossing hits of the year 
            and also found a place in Hindustan Times' list of 'Top 10 Patriotic Films of Hindi Cinema'.While the trade famously joked that the film should have 
            been named Ms. India,Rediff also stated that "Sridevi was a complete show-stealer in the film".Sridevi's imitation of Charlie Chaplin
             in the film was described by The Times of India as "the most hilarious act she has ever done".Rediff also featured Sridevi in its list of 
             'Super 6 Comic Heroines' stating that "her mobile face expressions could give Jim Carrey sleepless nights" and that "her biggest plus point is her ability 
             to be completely uninhibited in front of the camera".<br><br>
             ☛The dance number ''Hawaa Hawaai'', cited by The Times of India as "one of the unforgettable numbers of Sridevi",also became a popular nickname for the actress.
            Besides comedy, Sridevi featured in the video for the song ''Kaate Nahin Kat Te''; Filmfare described Sridevi as "truly a goddess in a blue sari".
             Rediff also featured the song in its list of 'Top 25 Sari Moments' praising Sridevi's "ability to look erotic even when she's covered from head-to-toe".
             Box Office India states that with the success of Mr. India, Sridevi "continued her domination" over her contemporaries Jaya Prada and Meenakshi Sheshadri.<br><br>
             ☛ 1989 saw the release of the Yash Chopra's romantic musical saga Chandni, with Sridevi playing the title role. The film emerged as one of the biggest blockbusters of 1989.
           Cited by The Times of India as "one of the most watched films of Indian cinema",the film also reaffirmed Sridevi's position as the top female star of the 1980s.
          While she topped the Hindustan Times' list of Yash Chopra's 'Top 5 Heroines', CNN-IBN also ranked her first on a similar list, saying "Yash Chopra immortalized 
          Sridevi as the perfect Chandni".India Today and NDTV also included her in such lists, stating that the film established Sridevi "as the nation's sweetheart".
          The Tribune wrote: "Leena Daru scored a winner again when she created the 'Chandni Look' for Sridevi. Every street corner sold the salwar-kameez and dupatta that 
          gave the heroine a refreshingly understated look, rarely seen on the Indian screen",Sridevi's dance number "Mere Haathon Mein Nau Nau Choodiyaan" proved also popular
           with audiences,and she also lent her voice to the film's popular title-track.<br><br>
           ☛The same year, Sridevi also starred in ChaalBaaz, which had her play a double role of twin sisters separated at birth. Filmfare ranked her performance #4 in its list of 
          '80 Iconic Performances of Hindi Cinema', stating that "Sridevi's penchant for giggles and her ability to look distinctly tearful when required polishes these performances
           to perfection. Hell, she made Sunny Deol and Rajinikanth look like sidekicks in the film".The Times of India article 'Bollywood's Hit Double Roles' wrote, "Sridevi's
            performance had rocked the box office".Rediff featured the film in its countdown of "25 Best Double Roles in Bollywood" saying "What you don't realise until you have
             seen Chaalbaaz is just how incredible Sridevi is at depicting both ends of the spectrum",and that the film "cemented her position as an actress with a killer comic timing".
              Speaking to The Indian Express about Sridevi's act in ChaalBaaz, the director Pankaj Parashar said "She proved her range with the movie and after that she got lots of offers 
              which saw her in a double role".Her slapstick rain dance "Na Jaane Kahaan Se Aayi Hai" became successful with The Times of India describing it as "a Sridevi classic where she 
              simply looked wow with her chirpy expressions and rain drops kissing her cheeks."Sridevi garnered Best Actress nominations at Filmfare for both Chandni and ChaalBaaz in 1989, 
              winning for the latter.<br><br>
              ☛Chopra then cast Sridevi in his 1991 intergenerational musical romantic drama Lamhe. The Times of India included it in its list of 'Top 10 Films of Yash Chopra' describing it
               as a tale of "love transcending the boundaries of time and space" while Rediff called it "Quite easily one of his most definitive films, Chopra surpassed his own findings of 
               romance with the insightful, lovely Lamhe." Sridevi played both the roles of mother and daughter in what iDiva described as "another double role but it was unlike any played before.
               "Hailed by Rediff as "one of the most remarkable films of her career... often considered a film way ahead of its time", Sridevi's folk dance number 'Morni Baga Ma' also became a rage
                and was placed among the 'Top 5 Songs' of Yash Chopra by Hindustan Times.Lamhe was an underwhelming success at the box-office, but received widespread critical acclaim and has become
                 a cult classic over the years. Talking about the film, critic Rachel Dwyer wrote in her biography of the film-maker "Chopra's own favourite film, Lamhe (Moments (1991)), divided the 
                 audience on a class basis: it was hugely popular with metropolitan elites and the overseas market, which allowed it to break even, but it had a poor box-office response (largely 
                 lower-class, especially the repeat audience) because of its supposed incest theme".The Hindu reported that "With shades of incest, Lamhe caused more than a flutter and remained 
                 the talk of the town",while Sridevi herself admitted in an interview with Rajeev Masand that she found the subject "too bold".Though the film flopped at the box-office,
                  with Rediff describing its failure as "one of those bizarre, unexplained moments of cinema",Lamhe picked up 5 Filmfare trophies including Best Film and a second Best Actress 
                  trophy for Sridevi. Her popular Rajasthani costumes in the film also won designer Neeta Lulla her first National Film Award for Best Costume Design.<br><br>
                  ☛In 1992, Sridevi starred in the epic drama Khuda Gawah opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The actress played a double role again as an Afghan warrior Benazir and her daughter Mehndi. 
          Shot mostly in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan,it did good business with BBC reporting that "it ran to packed houses for 10 weeks in Kabul". Khuda Gawah still remains popular in 
          Afghanistan and Rediff reported that the film is "in great demand after the reopening of cinema halls in the country" in 2001. At Filmfare, the film picked up the Best Director
           trophy, while Sridevi earned a nomination for Best Actress. During the production of Jurassic Park in 1992–93, acclaimed Hollywood director and producer Steven Spielberg approached 
           Sridevi for a small role in the film. However, Sridevi, after evaluating the stature of the role, refused the offer. She was the highest-paid actress in India from 1985 to 1993.<br><br>
           ☛Sridevi's big-budget 1993 release Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja was one of India's most expensive films ever made. Though the film failed at the box office, Sridevi was appreciated with 
           Times of India calling her disguise in a comedy scene "the best ever South Indian role played by any actress".She next starred in the 1993 thriller Gumrah, opposite Sanjay Dutt. Directed
            by Mahesh Bhatt, the actress played a singer falsely accused of drugs smuggling in Hong Kong. Bollyspice stated in its 'Sridevi Retrospective' that "Despite great performances from the

                 Her father died in 1990 of heart attack, while she was shooting for Lamhe. Her mother died in 1996,as a result of the complications suffered from an operation that she underwent 
                 in 1995 on a brain tumor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The neurosurgeon operated on the wrong side of her brain destroying her vital tissues of vision

          but the movie-buff’s dream".Commenting on her reserved nature, Firstpost says; "Behind the glamorous heroine with twinkling, magical eyes and a stunning face, was an inherently shy woman, often
           mistaken as arrogant. The truth is she was shy. Having begun to act when she was just 4, she did not complete formal education or get much of a chance to interact with kids of her own age.
            Consequently, she developed a strong dislike for crowds and noise."
